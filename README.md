# Neural Net - Genetic Algorithm Obstacle Avoidance

A neural network approach to path planning and obstacle avoidance simulation of a dynamically modelled 4-wheeled robot , trained using a genetic algorithm.

The dynamic model used was refactored a four wheeled robot model designed by Dr Kevin Worrall at the University of Glasgow.
